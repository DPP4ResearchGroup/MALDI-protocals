\textbf{R&D Proteome Purify} 
\\
\textsc{Removal of albumin and IgG}
\\
Composition: 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item{50/50 (v/v) slurry of proprietary absorption gel in PBS with 0.02\% sodium azide (pH7.4)}
    \item{Tube filter with 0.22 \mu m cellulose acetate membrane (capable of 1K-2K x g)}
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Procedures}
\textit{Bring immunodepletion Resin to room temp before use and perform at room temp} \\
\textit{It is essential that the immunodepletion Resin be homogeneous. Mix well bey inversion prior to pipetting}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item {Add 10 \mu L of serum or plasma to a test tube}
    \item {Add 1.0 mL of suspended Immunodepletion Resin to the test tube containing the sample}
    \item {Place the tube on a rotary shaker and mix for 30-60 mins. The mix speed should be sufficient to keep the immunodepletion Resin in suspension}
    \item {After the incubation period, pepette equal amounts of the Immunodepletion Resin Mixture into the upper chamber of two Spin-X Filter}
    
\end{enumerate}
